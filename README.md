# Mistral 7B Fine-Tuning with Transformers

This repository contains a project for fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model, pre-trained on a casual language model (casualLM), using the `torch`, `wandb`, and `transformers` libraries. After fine-tuning, the model is used for text generation tasks.

## Introduction

Mistral 7B is a state-of-the-art language model designed for a variety of natural language processing tasks. This project focuses on fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model for improved performance in text generation.

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. The main libraries used are `torch` for deep learning, `transformers` from Hugging Face for model handling, and `wandb` for experiment tracking.

## Training

The training process involves configuring `wandb` for tracking the experiment, loading the pre-trained Mistral 7B model and tokenizer, and fine-tuning the model on a dataset. The training configuration includes settings for batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, and logging.

## Text Generation

After the model is fine-tuned, it can be used for text generation. The process involves loading the fine-tuned model and tokenizer, providing an input prompt, and generating text based on that prompt. The output can be customized in terms of length and number of sequences generated.

## Results

The training progress and results can be monitored on the Weights & Biases dashboard. The final model, along with its configurations and metrics, is saved for future use in the specified output directory.
